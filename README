A base class for TiddlyWeb to simplify the development of serializers 
in particular those which exchange bags, recipes and tiddlers as 
representations in a _generic_ format, such as JSON, XML, YAML, etc.

The simplerizer pacakge uses the dump and load objects to implement
all of the known core methods for exchanging representations with TiddlyWeb
resources. This contrasts with the core TiddlyWeb SerializionInterface
which throws "NotImplemented" exceptions for methods not explicity defined.
Both approaches may have merit, hence this being offered as a plugin.

The following simplerizer based plugin is a replacement for the core
json serializer:

    from simplejson import dumps, loads
    from tiddlyweb.simplerizer import SerializerInterface 

    def init(config):
        # register the serializer
        content_type = "text/json"
        config["extension_types"]["json"] = content_type
        config["serializers"][content_type] = [__name__, "text/json; charset=UTF-8"]

    class Serialization(SerializationInterface):
        """Access TiddlyWeb resources using the JSON representation."""

        def dump(self, o):
            """Dump an object as a FOO string."""
            return simplejson.dumps(o)

        def load(self, s):
            """Load an object from a FOO string."""
            return simplejson.loads(s)

To use this code install the package and and add 'tiddlywebplugins.simplerizer'
to install_requires section of setup.py for your serializer package:

    install_requires = ['setuptools', 'pyyaml', 'tiddlyweb.simplerizer', 'tiddlyweb'],
